# Ideas
We could allow language spesific things too, like for example one-liners in python
we could also have snippets for spesific popular libraries

we should also like create a way to help developers to learn about dates, dates are hard

there should also be a request snippet and request tutorial thing


## Monetisation

ads, subscriptions, and ko-fi/patreon

we could host it:

or with money
